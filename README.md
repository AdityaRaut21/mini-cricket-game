# mini-cricket-game
A mini cricket game using C++
This game is played using the CLI where we can create our team from a pool of players.
Once the team is created, we toss the coin and choose whether to bowl or bat first.
Then the game commences and we start playing the game ball by ball for 6 overs.
The runs scored are RNG and the falling of wickets is decided by the criteria if the bowler's and the batter's RNG number is the same
